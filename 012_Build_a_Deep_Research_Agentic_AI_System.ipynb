        "This project focuses on building a **Planning Agent for Deep Research and Structured Report Generation**. The agent automates the process of analyzing a user-defined topic, performing web research, and generating a well-structured report. The workflow includes the following components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Report Planning**:\n",
        "   - The agent analyzes the user-provided **topic** and **default report template** to create a custom plan for the report.\n",
        "   - Sections such as **Introduction**, **Key Sections**, and **Conclusion** are defined based on the topic.\n",
        "   - A **web search tool** is used to collect information required before deciding the main sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Parallel Execution for Research and Writing**:\n",
        "   - The agent uses **parallel execution** to efficiently perform:\n",
        "     - **Web Research**: Queries are generated for each section and executed via the web search tool to retrieve up-to-date information.\n",
        "     - **Section Writing**: The retrieved data is used to write content for each section, with the following process:\n",
        "       - The **Researcher** gathers relevant data from the web.\n",
        "       - The **Section Writer** uses the data to generate structured content for the assigned section.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Formatting Completed Sections**:\n",
        "   - Once all sections are written, they are formatted to ensure consistency and adherence to the report structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Introduction and Conclusion Writing**:\n",
        "   - After the main sections are completed and formatted:\n",
        "     - The **Introduction** and **Conclusion** are written based on the content of the remaining sections (in parallel)\n",
        "     - This process ensures that these sections align with the overall flow and insights of the report.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Compilation**:\n",
        "   - All completed sections are compiled together to generate the **final report**.\n",
        "   - The final output is a comprehensive and structured document in the style of wiki docs.\n",
