        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will be building an Agentic AI system â€” HealthBuddy â€” using LangGraph with built-in utility functions. This system will act as an intelligent assistant that can:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Understand user queries about health\n",
        "- Research using web and arXiv tools\n",
        "- Recommend appropriate doctors based on user symptoms\n",
        "\n",
        "We will follow the **ReAct principle** (Reason + Act) to let the agent think, use tools when needed, observe results, and provide a well-formed final answer. Instead of relying on built-in LLM knowledge alone, the agent will use **external tools** to gather accurate and helpful information before responding.\n",
